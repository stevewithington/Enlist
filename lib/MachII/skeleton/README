This is the skeleton for the final release of Mach-II 1.9. 

This skeleton is intended to give you a jumpstart on building 
Mach-II applications by providing a basic template for Mach-II 
applications.

N.B. Please note that the skeleton is not a fully running application 
and doesn't "do" much of anything. It's provided strictly as an 
empty shell of a Mach-II application into which to start developing
your new Mach-II application in.

N.B. If you are using ColdFusion Builder, then use the MachBuilder
plugin which is included in in 

1. Copy the files in the /MachII/skeleton folder to a directory of 
   your choosing. Be sure to mentally note the path on your drive.

2. You will need to set a few parameters/values in the mach-ii.xml
   file which you can find in the /config directory where you placed
   your copy of the skeleton files:

	a. %DASHBOARDPASSWORD%
	   Change this value to the password you want to use to access 
	   the dashboard. Your password cannot start or end with a '%'.
	
	b. %APPROOTPATH%
	    1)	If you unzipped the skeleton in the webroot, then change 
	        the value of %APPROOTPATH% to "/".
    	2)	If you unzipped the the skeleton in a sub-directory of your 
    		webroot, then change the value of %APPROOTPATH% to "/[path]" 
    		where [path] is the directory off your webroot.
    		
    		For example, if you put the skeleton in a directory called 
    		"/myapp" (i.e.  http://localhost/myapp) then the value should 
    		be "/myapp".

    c. %EVENTPARAMETER%
       Change this to the value you want to use for an event parameter.
       The common standard is to use "event" or "go".

3. Save your changes to the mach-ii.xml file. 


4. Test Mach-II and your skeleton installation calling the showHome event:

   http://server[/path]/index.cfm?event=showHome 

   This event will display a page giving you basic feedback on whether or not 
   Mach-II and ColdSpring are configured correctly.
